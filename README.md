# Kata BDD Spring Cucumber

Imagine that you were hired to make a system that is responsible to validate the
check-ins from a Air flight company. The system uses miroservices architecture and
it has a login service, air flight service. Imagine that your team are responsible 
for developing just the air flight service and we need to mock any outside services
or api calls.

We were invited to a Sprint Planning and we have written the following user histories:

As a passenger. I want to do the check-in of my flights by the app 
from the mobile app. So that I can make easier my check-in with my cellphone and 
use it as my boarding pass.

- To run the tests you need to use `mvn test`

- To generate the reports `mvn install`
